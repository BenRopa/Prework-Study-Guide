## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- In order to gain a better understanding of CSS, git, JavaScript, and HTML we created a webpage which highlights some of our key notes. 
- We built this project in order to practice using GitHub, the git flow, and other important functions for the course. 
- Our application solves our issue of taking notes in too many different places. We now have a clean, polished, somewhat interactive page to display some of our prework study guide notes. 
- Prior to working with git, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, I did not recognize how these tools interact with one another. I now understanding that HTML makes up the layout of a website, along with text and written content. Git is a version control system that allows us to navigate through our code repository locally. JavaScript is used in order to create interactive effects in web browsers- it will enable us to create more dynamic applications that better the user experience. CSS or cascading style sheets is used to style our web page's font, color, size, and spacing of content.

## Usage

Our Prework Study Guide webpage can be used to refer to our baseline notes and defintions on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. Through use of chrome dev tools, we can right click our webpage, select "Console," and look at the JavaScipt running. Our program also has the ability to choose one topic for us to study first.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
